5th week:
21/10/2020:
• in-depth study on the documentaion of Olami API
• first attempt to implement our own NLP module (in English language) *"the greeting module" to make chatbot perform simple greeting response
• creating our own module keywords, grammar, syntax, sentence structures, sentence patterns
• applying the customized NLP module with our chatbot for interaction testing

22/10/2020:
• begin with the very first genuine NLP module for our scope regrading "school facilities"
• drafting the possible questions strutures,patterns and the way that users may ask
• implementing the keywords, grammar and syntax for the NLP module
• initiating sentence structures and patterns for the module

6th week:
28/10/2020:
• continue to collect related useful data and informations for school facilities questions (from school website, school notices at campus)
• continue to modify and add new keywords,syntax to enrich "school facilities" NLP module
• forming more sentence structures and patterns for this module

29/10/2020:
• modifying with chatbot codes
• apply "school facilities" module to the chatbot as the first test with a genuine customized NLP module for the scope
• debug with inappropriate response, inappropriate data feedback
• discover and investigate into the latency of response from chatbot

7th week:
04/11/2020:
• debug and modify the codes and school facilities NLP module
• better the performance of the chatbot
• preparation and discussion on the proposal powerpoint

05/11/2020:
• plan and draft the content of the proposal powerpoint
• divide the parts of the ppt to be prepared by each member
• individual work on the ppt

**07/11/2020:	(sat)
• combine the individual ppt work
• modify and organize the combined work

**08/11/2020:	(sun) 
• finalize the ppt
• prepare the script for the presentation
• rehearsal for proposal presentation
• test the chatbot with the greeting and school facilities NLP module

**09/11/2020:	(mon)
• final rehearsal in the early morning
• final test with chatbot for demo in the early morning




8th week:
11/11/2020:
• review on our performance of the presentation
• investigate into the failure of the demo during presentation
• try to stimulate the issues faced during presentation (but fail to stimulate the scenario again)
• discovery on server timeout and server issues that may be the reasons behind
• research and google on the issue

12/11/2020:
• try the methods and possible solutions found
• modify and debug with the codes regarding the issues (As the issues were caused by the throwing out of Timeout Error, use the try and catch error handler to catch that specific error) 
• find alternatives to avoid encountering the issue again 

9th week:
18/11/2020:
• continue to modify and enrich our NLP modules
• chatbot interaction and performance testing
• discuss and share ideas on the first additional function

19/11/2020:
• implement the first additional function prototype (user panel)	*1.to handle the preset protocol when starting the chatbot, 2.the user can call this panel out anytime, at the first stage we implement it with just the questions selection that user may ask
• add Chinese keywords to the school facilities module and modify the syntax and sentence structures (*aim to make it more user-friendly, allow users to ask questions with some unofficial chinese terms that are recognized by HKUSPACE students)
• chatbot interaction and performance

**23/11/2020:	(mon)	
• final test for the second time demo in the early morning




10th week:
25/11/2020:
• adopt professor’s suggestion to make chatbot in a more A.I. oriented approach (aim to make the chatbot and fyp more valuable)
• discussion on how to make our tradition chatbot to be more than a matching machine (more AI)
• research on machine learning algorithms in python library 
• watching tutorial videos on the use of learning algorithms on youtube
• study the documentation for machine learning (the concepts and the mechanism)
• regular modification for the NLP modules with more sentence patterns
• rearrange the time schedule and work division

26/11/2020:
• research and find the way to apply our NLP modules to machine learning (we found that it is genuinely a challenge with respect to how we started the implementation of this chatbot)
• analysis and take references with others' chatbot samples with machine learning approach implemented in the first place
• recognize that there's exist a library called nltk which would be useful for nlp as it contain many predefined dictionary and function to tokenise the message
• recognize that it may be necessary to rebuild a list of input data (or word vector list) from the predefined repository at the start of machine learning application, TensorFlow may need to be introduced to our fyp
• recognize it might require a 24/7 server (not a test one) for machine learning, Heroku may need to be introduced into the application

11th week:
02/12/2020:
• learn how to make use of nltk
• learn how to handle the Heroku server and try to initialize one
• learn how to use TensorFlow function to build the word vector list and do machine learning

03/12/2020:
• customized word vector list start building
• start to manage the raw information and integrated into word vector format for two new categories for the adoption
